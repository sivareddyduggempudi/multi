Market Research & AI Use Case Generation System

Objective
To design and implement a Multi-Agent System that:
•	Conducts deep market research on a given Company/Industry.
•	Identifies AI/ML/GenAI use cases tailored to the company's goals.
•	Collects relevant resource assets (datasets, projects) for practical AI solution building.
•	Focuses on enhancing operations, supply chain, internal processes, and customer experience.
Methodology
Agents Design:
•	Research Agent:
o	Queries Gemini to understand company background, industry, products, and strategy.
•	Use Case Generation Agent:
o	Based on research, generates 5-7 actionable AI/GenAI/ML use cases.
•	Resource Asset Collection Agent:
o	Collects relevant public datasets from Kaggle, GitHub, Hugging Face.
•	Bonus GenAI Solutions Agent:
o	Suggests advanced GenAI solutions for internal automation and customer-facing features.
LLM Model:
•	All agents use Google Gemini Pro for LLM-powered reasoning.
•	Here I used Gemini models as it is free to use.
Interface:
•	Streamlit based web app for easy input, visualization, and download.




Results:
1. Comprehensive Market Research
The system successfully conducted market research using the Google Gemini model and online resources (web scraping) to understand the industry and specific company operations. The research included:
•	Industry Overview: It explored key segments like Automotive, Healthcare, Retail, etc., based on the company’s focus area.
•	Company-Specific Insights: Identified key offerings and strategic focus areas (operations, supply chain, customer experience, etc.).
•	Industry Trends: This analysis included leveraging resources from McKinsey, Deloitte, Nexocode, and other relevant AI industry reports.
2. Generation of Relevant Use Cases
Based on the research findings, the system generated 5-7 relevant AI/GenAI use cases for the company. These were designed to:
•	Address specific pain points in the company's operations.
•	Enhance customer experience through automation, predictive models, and AI-driven decision-making.
For example, for Tesla, use cases included:
1.	Predictive Maintenance for vehicle IoT sensors (improving operational efficiency).
2.	AI-powered Customer Support Chatbots for better service response times.
3.	Autonomous Supply Chain Optimization using ML for parts logistics.
4.	AI-powered Document Intelligence systems for processing vehicle documents.
5.	Generative AI in Design Prototyping for faster innovation cycles.
6.	Energy Optimization in Gigafactories to save costs and improve sustainability.
3. Collected Resource Assets
The Resource Asset Collection Agent successfully fetched datasets and relevant resources for each generated use case. These included:
•	Datasets from Kaggle, GitHub, HuggingFace, and UCI (e.g., predictive maintenance data, manufacturing process datasets).
•	Code repositories and frameworks to aid implementation (e.g., for vehicle service chatbots, supply chain optimization, and document processing).
These assets were linked as clickable resources for easy access:


•	Predictive Maintenance Dataset on Kaggle
•	GitHub Project for Vehicle Service Chatbot
•	UCI Manufacturing Process Data
4. Bonus AI Solutions
The Bonus GenAI Solutions Agent proposed additional AI solutions for internal operations and customer-facing features, such as:
•	Internal: Document search engines, automated report generation.
•	Customer-facing: AI-driven chatbots for personalized interactions, voice-controlled assistants in vehicles.
5. Proposal Summary and Feasibility
The final proposal compiled all use cases, resources, and insights into a well-structured document:
•	Top Use Cases: Tailored to the company’s goals and operations.
•	Actionable Insights: Provided clear suggestions for leveraging GenAI, LLMs, and ML technologies.
•	Data Sets and Resources: Linked to platforms like Kaggle, GitHub, and HuggingFace.


Conclusions:
•	This multi-agent system offers a complete end-to-end solution for companies looking to adopt AI/GenAI solutions efficiently.
•	By aligning AI solutions to specific operational needs and offering practical datasets, it allows a company to accelerate digital transformation meaningfully.
